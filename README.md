# Bayesian-Network-Learning-C++17


##### Code to Create a bayesian network
##### Learn the probabilities of bayesian network using the data
##### And perform inference
##### Use forward sampling to get samples from the distribution and learn the parameters again


#### Requirements :
##### C++17 - because C++11 does not have shared_ptr with dynamic array type functionality
##### 	    - To upgrade to g++-7 use the instructions in the link: https://gist.github.com/jlblancoc/99521194aba975286c80f93e47966dc5
